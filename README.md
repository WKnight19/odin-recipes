## ODIN PROJECT - Recipes

### This project is the first initial project of the course, from the very first lesson, all the way to the basics of HTML and Git

### This will be testing my aptitude for the basics, so ill see how it goes and write the basics of the project below...

# Reflection and Features, Post-Project
- added recipes for pizza, burgers, and chicken and rice
- added images that are in svg format to all recipes
- added to github pages

- looks really consistent with other similar projects, although the image sizing could use some work, as wekk as the depth of the recipes.
